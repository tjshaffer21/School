At the time of writing these programs they worked successfully on a Windows machine. I know that there was a few problems with textures when I tried to run them on a Linux machine. Other than that, they should work the same as they did for class.

Most likely, I will not try to fix any problems that might be available. I may eventually work on a renderer again, but I would much rather start from scratch and use these old ones as a point of reference.
